While implementing the get_books.py script, I initially encountered issues with writing and structuring the correct lines of code. To resolve this, I frequently referred to the current lesson material and previous lessons, especially to recall how to use methods like .join() or how to save data in JSON format.

Another challenge occurred when I ran the script and received an error related to Chrome not being installed. After installing Chrome, I reran the script and it worked correctly. 

Task 6 also presented some difficulties with understanding and using XPath expressions. I wasn’t sure how to properly select elements using `strong` and `contains`, or why the `@` symbol was needed for attributes. I reviewed the XPath resources linked in the lesson and experimented in the browser’s developer tools to test XPath queries until I got the correct results.

Overall, the combination of lesson resources, testing code incrementally, and learning by trial and error helped me overcome these challenges.
